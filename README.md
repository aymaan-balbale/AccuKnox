##  automating the process

### ðŸ¤– Automation Script
To ensure full reproducibility and demonstrate the assessment workflow, a comprehensive bash script, `run_assessment.sh`, is included in this repository.

This script automates the following actions:
- Creates an output directory.
- Runs the Nmap, Nikto, sslscan, and Gobuster scans in sequence.
- Saves all evidence to organized text files.

You can view the script here: [**run_assessment.sh**](run_assessment.sh)
